# SPACCC: Spanish Clinical Case Corpus

This repository contains the Spanish Clinical Case Corpus. 


## Document selection

The SPACCC corpus was created after collecting 1,000 clinical cases from SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online), 
an electronic library that gathers electronic publications of complete full text articles from scientific journals of 
Latin America, South Africa and Spain (http://www.scielo.org).

A clinician classified those cases into those that were similar to real clinical texts in terms of structure and content 
and those that were not suitable for this task. Figure legends were automatically removed and in case multiple clinical 
cases were listed, these were split into single clinical cases.
